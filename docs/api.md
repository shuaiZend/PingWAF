# PingWAF REST API Reference

Base URL: `https://your-server:9080/api/v1`

The control plane serves HTTPS by default (`tls_enabled = true`) with a
self-signed certificate generated on first boot, so `curl` needs `-k` until the
certificate is trusted or replaced (see
[Control-plane certificate](#control-plane-certificate)). When TLS is disabled
(`tls_enabled = false`, e.g. TLS terminated by a reverse proxy) the same port
serves plain HTTP.

Cleartext requests to a TLS-enabled listener are answered with `308 Permanent
Redirect` to the `https://` URL on the same host, so scripts should either use
`https://` directly or follow redirects. The two health endpoints (`/healthz`
and `/api/v1/health`) are exempt and answer on both schemes, which keeps
container health checks working without a certificate.

## Authentication

All endpoints (except `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/status`, the
passkey sign-in pair `/auth/passkey/login/begin`, `/auth/passkey/login/finish`,
`/health` and `/version`) require a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### POST /auth/login

Authenticate and receive tokens.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "admin@pingwaf.local",
  "password": "pingwaf123"
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 43200,
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "admin@pingwaf.local",
    "name": "Administrator",
    "role": "admin",
    "must_change_password": false,
    "disabled": false,
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

The user object (also returned by `GET /auth/me`) carries two extra flags:
`must_change_password` is `true` for freshly seeded accounts — the server
rejects every write until the password is changed — and `disabled` accounts
cannot sign in at all.

### POST /auth/register

Create a new account (when registration is open).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "secure-password",
  "name": "Optional Name"
}
```

**Response (201):** Same as login.

### POST /auth/refresh

Exchange a refresh token for new tokens.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "refresh_token": "eyJ..."
}
```

**Response (200):** Same as login.

### GET /auth/status

Check if setup is needed, and which credential types this deployment offers.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "needs_setup": false,
  "registration_open": true,
  "passkey_enabled": true
}
```

### GET /auth/me

Get current user profile. Same shape as the `user` object above, including the
`must_change_password` and `disabled` flags.

### PUT /auth/me

Update current user profile. Optionally change the login name (the `email`)
by supplying `email` together with `current_password` — the server answers
`400` when the password is missing or wrong and `409` when the login name is
already taken. A login-name change revokes every outstanding token, so the
console must sign in again.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "New Name",
  "email": "new-login-name@example.com",
  "current_password": "current-password"
}
```

### PUT /auth/password

Change password. The new password must be at least 8 characters.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "current_password": "old-password",
  "new_password": "new-password"
}
```

**Response (204):** empty.

A wrong `current_password` is a `400` (not a `401`), so clients do not treat a
typo as a dead session. Answers `204` on success. Changing the password also
clears the account's `must_change_password` flag, which is what releases a
first sign-in from the forced password change.

---

## Users

Dashboard user administration. Every route here requires the `admin` role.
Self-lockout is prevented: an administrator can neither change their own role
nor disable themselves, and the last enabled administrator can never be
downgraded or disabled.

Roles: `admin` (read and write everything), `auditor` (read-only across all
resources) and `viewer` (read-only).

### GET /users

List users (paginated).

### POST /users

Create an account. `role` defaults to `viewer`; `password` must be at least 8
characters. The new account starts with `must_change_password: true`.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "auditor@example.com",
  "password": "start-up-password",
  "name": "Compliance",
  "role": "auditor"
}
```

**Response (201):** the created user object (same shape as `GET /auth/me`).

### PUT /users/{user_id}

Update `name`, `role`, `disabled` and/or `email` (the login name). An
administrator cannot change their own `role`/`disabled` (`400`); downgrading
or disabling the last enabled administrator is rejected with `400` as well.
A login-name change revokes the account's outstanding tokens; a duplicate
login name is rejected with `409`.

---

## Passkeys

Passkeys (WebAuthn) are an alternative sign-in for a browser that owns a
platform authenticator or a security key. A passkey is always bound to an
account that is already signed in — the console mints them from Settings →
Passkeys, and the operator then signs in with the fingerprint/face/PIN prompt
instead of a password.

Two conditions must hold for the browser prompt to even appear:

* `GET /auth/status` reports `passkey_enabled: true` (the `passkey_enabled`
  server setting, on by default). When it is `false` every endpoint below
  answers `501`.
* The page is a secure context: HTTPS, or `localhost`. A passkey cannot be
  created for a bare IP address or over plain HTTP on a hostname. The control
  plane therefore serves HTTPS by default with a self-signed certificate that
  can be replaced under [Control-plane certificate](#control-plane-certificate);
  a bare-IP deployment needs that IP in the certificate's SANs.

### GET /auth/passkeys

List the passkeys bound to the signed-in account. Neither the credential id nor
the public key is exposed.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Work laptop",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "last_used_at": "2024-02-01T09:12:00Z"
  }
]
```

### PATCH /auth/passkeys/{passkey_id}

Rename a passkey.

**Request:**
```json
{ "name": "Work laptop" }
```

**Response (200):** the updated summary. Names are 1-100 characters.

### DELETE /auth/passkeys/{passkey_id}

Remove a passkey. Answers `204`. The credential can no longer sign in; the
account's password still can.

### POST /auth/passkey/register/begin

Start binding a new passkey to the signed-in account.

**Response (200):** `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` in the WebAuthn JSON
encoding (base64url strings, camelCase fields) to be handed to
`navigator.credentials.create()`.

```json
{
  "rp": { "id": "waf.example.com", "name": "PingWAF" },
  "user": { "id": "…", "name": "ops@example.com", "displayName": "Ops" },
  "challenge": "…",
  "pubKeyCredParams": [{ "type": "public-key", "alg": -7 }],
  "timeout": 300000,
  "excludeCredentials": [],
  "authenticatorSelection": { "residentKey": "preferred" },
  "attestation": "none"
}
```

### POST /auth/passkey/register/finish

Complete the ceremony with the credential returned by the browser.

**Request:** the standard registration response — `id`, `rawId`, `type`,
`response.{clientDataJSON, attestationObject, transports}` (base64url) plus an
optional `name` label and `clientExtensionResults`.

**Response (201):** the stored passkey summary, shaped like `GET /auth/passkeys`.

### POST /auth/passkey/login/begin

Start a password-less sign-in. Public — no bearer token.

**Response (200):** `PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions` (base64url `challenge`,
`rpId`, `allowCredentials`) to be handed to `navigator.credentials.get()`.

Because the account is not known yet, the authenticator must be able to
discover the credential (a "discoverable"/resident key). Passkeys minted through
`register/finish` are created as `residentKey: "preferred"`: platform
authenticators make them discoverable by default, but a legacy security key that
refuses to store the credential cannot be used for password-less sign-in.

### POST /auth/passkey/login/finish

Verify the assertion and mint a session. Public — no bearer token.

**Request:** the standard assertion — `id`, `rawId`, `type`,
`response.{clientDataJSON, authenticatorData, signature, userHandle}` (base64url)
and `clientExtensionResults`.

**Response (200):** identical to `POST /auth/login`, so the client stores the
tokens the same way.

**Errors:** every verification failure is a `400` with an `error` message — a
`401` would make the console log the operator out mid-ceremony.

Ceremony state lives in the database with a 5 minute lifetime, so several
control plane replicas can serve one ceremony without sticky sessions.
Unauthenticated challenges share a process-wide budget (120/minute); exceeding
it answers `429`.

**Configuration** (`ServerConfig`, environment overrides):

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `PINGWAF_PASSKEY_ENABLED` | `true` | Offer passkeys at all |
| `PINGWAF_PASSKEY_RP_NAME` | `PingWAF` | Relying party name shown by the browser |
| `PINGWAF_PASSKEY_RP_ID` | derived from `Host` | Relying party id (registrable domain) |
| `PINGWAF_PASSKEY_ORIGIN` | derived from `Host` | Exact origin the browser must report |
| `PINGWAF_PASSKEY_TRUST_FORWARDED_PROTO` | `false` | Honour `X-Forwarded-Proto` when deriving the origin |

Deriving from `Host` assumes the console is reached directly. Behind a reverse
proxy that terminates TLS, either set `PINGWAF_PASSKEY_ORIGIN` explicitly or turn
on `PINGWAF_PASSKEY_TRUST_FORWARDED_PROTO` — a wrong origin is an opaque
`SecurityError` in the browser, not a helpful message.

## Health & Version

### GET /health

Database connectivity check.

**Response (200):**
```json
{"status": "ok", "database": "up"}
```

### GET /version

Build metadata.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "name": "pingwaf-server",
  "version": "0.24.1",
  "api": "/api/v1",
  "registration_open": true
}
```

## Sites

A site is one protected domain plus its origin pools, rules and TLS posture. A
site may serve several hostnames: `domain` is the primary one and
`alternate_domains` lists the rest, all sharing the same routing, WAF and cache
configuration. Wildcards are accepted in the leading label (`*.example.com`)
and only match subdomains — the bare domain needs its own entry. A wildcard
never matches the apex, so `example.com` plus `*.example.com` is a valid pair.

Two sites may not claim overlapping hostnames: identical names, a wildcard
covering another site's hostname, and nested wildcards are all rejected with
`400` because pingap's host matching would make the winner depend on
configuration order. An ACME certificate for a wildcard hostname requires the
`dns-01` challenge with a configured DNS provider — `http-01` cannot validate
`*`, and the API refuses that combination.

`status` is the site lifecycle:

| Value | Edge behaviour |
|-------|----------------|
| `active` | Traffic is proxied normally |
| `paused` | Every request is answered `503` with `Retry-After: 3600` before any rule runs — the certificate keeps serving and the request is still logged, so pausing is visible in the console rather than a silent outage. The site's custom `503` page is used when one is configured. |
| `pending` | Serves normally; a bookkeeping state for sites that are not finished being set up |

Only `paused` changes how traffic is handled.

### GET /sites

List sites (paginated).

**Query Parameters:**
| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `page` | int | Page number (default: 1) |
| `page_size` | int | Items per page (default: 50, max: 200) |
| `search` | string | Filter by name/domain |
| `status` | string | Filter by status: `active`, `paused`, `pending` |

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "My Site",
      "domain": "example.com",
      "alternate_domains": ["api.example.com", "*.static.example.com"],
      "status": "active",
      "plan": "free",
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "trust_proxy_headers": false,
      "trusted_header": "",
      "trust_last_hop": false,
      "created_at": "...",
      "updated_at": "..."
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50
}
```

### POST /sites

Create a new site. `upstream_address` is required: a site without an origin cannot serve traffic. The site is created with a `default` origin pool containing that origin.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "My Site",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "alternate_domains": ["*.example.com"],
  "upstream_address": "10.0.1.50:3000",
  "upstream_name": "origin",
  "upstream_tls": false,
  "status": "active",
  "plan": "free"
}
```

**Response (201):** Site object.

### GET /sites/{site_id}

Get site details including upstreams and SSL config.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}

Update site fields, including the status that pauses and resumes a site:

```json
{ "status": "paused" }
```

Only the fields present in the body are touched. `alternate_domains` replaces
the whole list when present; `[]` clears it. Changing `domain` or
`alternate_domains` re-runs the cross-site hostname checks above.

Reverse-proxy trust fields: set `trust_proxy_headers: true` when the site is
behind a CDN/reverse proxy and `trusted_header` names the header the client IP
is resolved from (`x-forwarded-for` default; `cf-connecting-ip`, `x-real-ip`,
`true-client-ip`, `forwarded` accepted). `trust_last_hop: true` restricts the
lookup to the right-most value. With trust enabled, IP block lists, rate
limiting and logged client IPs derive from that header instead of the TCP
peer.

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}

Delete a site and all associated resources.

---

## Site Upstreams

### GET /sites/{site_id}/upstreams

List origin servers for a site.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/upstreams

Add an upstream (origin node). Without `pool_id` the node joins the site's default pool.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "app-server-1",
  "address": "10.0.1.50:3000",
  "weight": 1,
  "tls": false,
  "pool_id": "uuid"
}
```

`address` is `host[:port]`. A leading `http://` or `https://` is accepted and
stripped (copy-pasting a URL is normal), a trailing `/` is ignored, and anything
longer — a path, query or fragment — is rejected with `400` rather than silently
dropped, because a dropped path also corrupts the SNI derived from the host. To
speak TLS to the origin set `tls: true` or give the pool an `sni`.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/upstreams/{upstream_id}

Update an upstream.

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/upstreams/{upstream_id}

Remove an upstream.

### GET /sites/{site_id}/upstream-pools

List origin pools for a site, default pool first. Each pool:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "site_id": "uuid",
  "name": "default",
  "lb_algorithm": "round_robin",
  "sni": null,
  "verify_cert": null,
  "is_default": true,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### POST /sites/{site_id}/upstream-pools

Create an origin pool.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "primary",
  "lb_algorithm": "hash:cookie:session",
  "sni": "origin.example.com",
  "verify_cert": true
}
```

`lb_algorithm` accepts `round_robin`, `random`, `least_connections` or `hash:<type>[:<key>]` with type in `ip`, `url`, `path` (no key) or `header`, `cookie`, `query` (key required). A non-empty `sni` enables TLS to the origin.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/upstream-pools/{pool_id}

Update an origin pool (`sni: ""` disables origin TLS).

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/upstream-pools/{pool_id}

Remove an origin pool. Refused with `400` for the default pool and `409` while routes still reference it or origin nodes remain in it.

### GET /sites/{site_id}/routes

List path-based routes for a site, highest priority first. Each route:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "site_id": "uuid",
  "name": "api-to-dedicated-pool",
  "match_type": "prefix",
  "path": "/api",
  "priority": 512,
  "enabled": true,
  "pool_id": "uuid",
  "ip_group_id": null,
  "ip_group_name": null,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### POST /sites/{site_id}/routes

Create a route.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "api-to-dedicated-pool",
  "match_type": "prefix",
  "path": "/api",
  "priority": 512,
  "enabled": true,
  "pool_id": "uuid",
  "ip_group_id": "uuid"
}
```

`match_type` is `prefix`, `exact` or `regex`; `priority` (1-60000) is optional and defaults to the auto weight. `ip_group_id` is optional and must name an existing, enabled IP group visible to the caller whose membership is not empty; `ip_group_name` is filled in on responses.

A route with an IP group only matches clients whose address is inside one of the
group's CIDR ranges. Both conditions are ANDed, so the route above sends
`203.0.113.7` to the dedicated pool for `/api` but leaves every other client on
the default pool. This is how an internal-only or partner-only path is split off
without touching address-based access rules. The IP ranges are resolved when the
configuration is generated, so changing group membership takes effect after the
next configuration push — the agent does not need to be pointed at the group.
Routes without an IP group match any client.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/routes/{route_id}

Update a route (`priority: 0` resets it to the auto weight; `ip_group_id: null`
clears the group).

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/routes/{route_id}

Remove a route; matching traffic falls back to the default pool.

---

## Site SSL

### GET /sites/{site_id}/ssl

Get SSL configuration for a site.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/ssl

Create or update SSL settings. `domain` is required; TLS switches (https, HSTS, mTLS, TLS versions) are shared with the ssl-settings endpoint.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "https_enabled": true,
  "min_tls_version": "1.2",
  "hsts_enabled": true,
  "hsts_max_age": 31536000
}
```

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/ssl

Remove SSL settings.

### GET /sites/{site_id}/ssl-settings

The effective TLS posture of the site.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "https_enabled": true,
  "min_tls_version": "1.2",
  "max_tls_version": null,
  "self_signed": false,
  "certificate_id": "uuid",
  "mtls_enabled": false,
  "has_mtls_client_ca": false,
  "mtls_organization": null,
  "mtls_require_client_cert": false,
  "hsts_enabled": true,
  "hsts_max_age": 15552000,
  "always_use_https": true
}
```

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/ssl-settings

Update one or more fields; omitted fields keep their value. Requires the `write`
role.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "hsts_enabled": true,
  "hsts_max_age": 15552000,
  "always_use_https": true,
  "mtls_enabled": true,
  "mtls_require_client_cert": true,
  "mtls_organization": "Acme Devices"
}
```

| Field | Behaviour at the edge |
|-------|-----------------------|
| `hsts_enabled` / `hsts_max_age` | Adds `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<n>` to HTTPS responses. `max-age` is 1-63072000 seconds (two years); `hsts_max_age: 0` is what browsers read as "stop pinning", so the console defaults to `15552000` (180 days) when HSTS is switched on. |
| `always_use_https` | Plain HTTP requests are answered `301` with the `https://` equivalent before any rule runs. The two listeners share one location, so this is safe to enable with traffic on both ports. **Browsers cache HSTS**: when testing, keep `hsts_max_age` low or use a throwaway domain, or a redirect will haunt the browser for months. |
| `mtls_enabled` / `mtls_require_client_cert` / `mtls_organization` | Requires a client certificate; see [mTLS](#mtls). |
| `min_tls_version` / `max_tls_version` | Accepted as `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2` (default) or `1.3`. |

---

## Certificates

### GET /sites/{site_id}/certificates

List certificates for a site.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/certificates

Add a certificate (manual upload or ACME request).

**Request (manual):**
```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...",
  "key_pem": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...",
  "issuer": "Let's Encrypt",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "auto_renew": false
}
```

**Request (ACME):**
```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "acme_email": "ops@example.com",
  "acme_challenge_type": "dns-01",
  "acme_dns_provider": "cloudflare",
  "acme_dns_config": {"api_token": "..."},
  "auto_renew": true
}
```

`acme_challenge_type` is `http-01` or `dns-01`; `acme_dns_provider` is one of `cloudflare`, `route53`, `digitalocean`, `aliyun`, `dnspod`, `cloudxns`, `manual`.

### GET /sites/{site_id}/certificates/{cert_id}

Get certificate details.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/certificates/{cert_id}

Update certificate.

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/certificates/{cert_id}

Remove certificate.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/certificates/{cert_id}/renew

Trigger manual certificate renewal (ACME-managed certificates only).

### GET /certificates/summary

Certificate counts across every site the caller may see (administrators: all
sites; other accounts: their own). Handy for a dashboard badge — one call
instead of paging through every site.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "total": 12,
  "active": 10,
  "pending": 1,
  "failed": 0,
  "expired": 0,
  "expiring_soon": 1
}
```

`expiring_soon` counts certificates that lapse within the next 30 days,
already-lapsed ones included.

### GET /certificates/{cert_id}/events

Event log for one certificate, newest first (paginated).

**Query Parameters:**
| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event_type` | string | Filter by event type (e.g., `created`, `renewal_requested`, `renewed`, `failed`, `deleted`, `acme_raw`) |
| `page` | int | Page number |
| `page_size` | int | Items per page |

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "certificate_id": "uuid",
      "site_id": "uuid",
      "event_type": "renewal_requested",
      "message": "Manual renewal requested for example.com",
      "details": null,
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "domain": "example.com",
      "site_domain": null
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50
}
```

### GET /ssl-events

Cross-certificate event log for every site the caller may see (paginated). Supports the same `certificate_id` and `event_type` filters; each event additionally carries the resolved `domain` and `site_domain`.

---

## mTLS

Mutual TLS for one site: the edge asks the client for a certificate, and a
request only reaches the origin when that certificate was issued by a CA the
site trusts, has not been revoked, and was issued for this site.

Two halves work together:

* **Trust and revocation** live here — a CA (generated by the control plane or
  imported) plus the client certificates issued from it.
* **Enforcement** is the site's TLS posture: set `mtls_enabled: true` via
  `PUT /sites/{site_id}/ssl-settings`, and `mtls_require_client_cert: true` to
  refuse requests that present no certificate at all. Setting `mtls_organization`
  pins the organization a client certificate must carry, which is what keeps a
  certificate issued for one site from being replayed against another.

Adding or removing a CA rewrites the site's trust anchor and pushes the
configuration; a site that loses its last CA is left with `mtls_enabled: false`
rather than enabled-but-unverifiable.

Only certificates generated here come with a private key, and the key is
returned **exactly once** — when the CA or the certificate is created. Imported
CAs act as trust anchors only.

> Certificates generated by the control plane are stored unencrypted in the
> database. Treat a database dump as key material.

### GET /sites/{site_id}/mtls/cas

List the site's CAs. Private keys are never included; `has_private_key` and the
SHA-256 fingerprint are.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "site_id": "uuid",
    "name": "Acme device CA",
    "source": "generated",
    "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n…",
    "has_private_key": true,
    "subject_dn": "CN=Acme device CA",
    "serial": "0a1b…",
    "fingerprint_sha256": "9f2c…",
    "expected_organization": "Acme Devices",
    "not_before": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "not_after": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "certificate_count": 3
  }
]
```

### POST /sites/{site_id}/mtls/cas

Create a CA. Requires the `write` role.

**Request (generate):**
```json
{
  "name": "Acme device CA",
  "organization": "Acme Devices",
  "validity_days": 3650
}
```

**Request (import):**
```json
{
  "name": "Corporate PKI",
  "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n…",
  "organization": "Acme Devices"
}
```

`cert_pem` switches to import mode: the certificate becomes a trust anchor and
no private key is involved. `validity_days` is capped at 3650 for a CA.

**Response (201):** the CA plus `key_pem`, present only for a generated CA and
only on this response.

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/mtls/cas/{ca_id}

Delete a CA. Refused with `400` while any client certificate issued from it still
exists — revoked ones included, since they are what keeps the revocation list
intact.

### GET /sites/{site_id}/mtls/certificates

List client certificates, revoked ones included (`status` is `active` or
`revoked`). `ca_name` is filled in for convenience.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "site_id": "uuid",
    "ca_id": "uuid",
    "ca_name": "Acme device CA",
    "name": "laptop-1",
    "common_name": "laptop-1",
    "organization": "Acme Devices",
    "serial": "1f0c…",
    "fingerprint_sha256": "c4d1…",
    "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n…",
    "has_private_key": true,
    "not_before": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "not_after": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "status": "active",
    "revoked_at": null,
    "revocation_reason": null,
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

### POST /sites/{site_id}/mtls/certificates

Issue a client certificate from one of the site's CAs.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "ca_id": "uuid",
  "name": "laptop-1",
  "common_name": "laptop-1",
  "organization": "Acme Devices",
  "validity_days": 365
}
```

`name`, `common_name` and `organization` default to the CA's values; the
validity is capped at the CA's own `not_after`, because a certificate outliving
its CA verifies against nothing.

**Response (201):** the certificate plus `key_pem`, returned exactly once.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/mtls/certificates/{cert_id}/revoke

Revoke a certificate. The fingerprint joins the site's revocation list and the
configuration is pushed, so the very next request with that certificate is
refused with `403` — no waiting for a CRL or an OCSP check.

**Request:**
```json
{ "reason": "laptop lost" }
```

**Response (200):** the updated certificate.

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/mtls/certificates/{cert_id}

Delete a certificate row. An `active` certificate must be revoked first (`400`
otherwise) so that removing a record cannot quietly re-admit a client that is
still holding the key. Revoking also removes its fingerprint from the deny list;
the request-detail history keeps naming it.

### GET /sites/{site_id}/mtls/certificates/{cert_id}/download

Download the certificate, and its private key when it has one, as a single PEM
bundle (`application/x-pem-file`) suitable for `curl --cert`.

### How a client presents it

```bash
curl --cert laptop-1.pem --key laptop-1.pem https://example.com/
```

Requests that reach the site from a client without a usable certificate are
answered `403` and recorded as access-log rows only — they are not WAF verdicts
and do not show up as security events.

---

## API Keys

Keys authenticate an agent (or any script) without a user password. The
plaintext is shown once, at creation; the row keeps a bcrypt hash and the first
8 characters for display. Agents send the key as `Authorization: Bearer pwk_…`.

### GET /keys

List API keys (paginated). Administrators see every key, other callers see their
own. The plaintext is never returned here.

### POST /keys

Create a new API key. Requires the `write` role.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Agent Key",
  "permissions": ["agent", "read"],
  "expires_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Label, 1-100 characters (required) |
| `permissions` | string[] | Any of `agent`, `read`, `write`; defaults to `["agent", "read"]` |
| `expires_at` | string | RFC 3339 instant in the future; omitted = never expires |

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "name": "Agent Key",
  "key_prefix": "pwk_9f2c",
  "key": "pwk_9f2c8d1e…",
  "permissions": ["agent", "read"],
  "expires_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "last_used_at": null,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

> The full key is returned **only** by this call. `last_used_at` is filled in as
> agents authenticate.

### DELETE /keys/{key_id}

Revoke an API key. Answers `204`; the key stops authenticating immediately.
Administrators may revoke any key, other callers only their own.

---

## Agents

### GET /agents

List registered agents.

**Query Parameters:**
| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `page` | int | Page number |
| `page_size` | int | Items per page |
| `site_id` | string | Filter by site |
| `status` | string | Filter: `online`, `offline`, `degraded` |

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "site_id": "uuid",
      "site_domain": "example.com",
      "hostname": "edge-01",
      "ip_address": "10.0.1.5",
      "version": "0.24.1",
      "os_info": "Linux 6.1.0",
      "cpu_cores": 4,
      "memory_bytes": 8589934592,
      "status": "online",
      "last_heartbeat": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
      "registered_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "connected": true,
      "pending_commands": 0
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

### POST /agents/enroll

Mint an agent API key and get back the command line that brings a node
online. Any account with write access (non-viewer). The agent registers
itself over gRPC on first connect, so running the returned command is all
that is needed for the node to appear in `GET /agents`.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "edge-01"
}
```

`name` is optional — it labels the minted key in `GET /keys` and defaults to
`agent-enrollment-<timestamp>`. Max `100` characters.

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "key_id": "uuid",
  "token": "pwk_…",
  "server_url": "waf.example.com:9090",
  "install_command": "curl -fsSL …/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --mode agent --server-url waf.example.com:9090 --api-key pwk_…"
}
```

`token` is returned exactly once — only its hash is stored. It is already part
of `install_command`; API callers may build their own command from it.
`server_url` is the caller's host plus the configured gRPC port (the bind
address is not routable from another server). The key carries the `agent` and
`read` permissions. Running `install_command` on a fresh host installs the
binary, writes the node configuration and starts the service, so the node
registers itself without further steps.

### GET /agents/{agent_id}

Get agent details.

### GET /agents/{agent_id}/samples

Host probe history (CPU, memory, network, disk), newest first. Cumulative counters (network and disk totals) are returned raw; difference consecutive rows to obtain rates.

**Query params:** `from`, `to` (RFC 3339), `page`, `page_size`.

### GET /agents/{agent_id}/metrics

Aggregated edge-metric history shipped by the agent (`pingwaf_requests_total`, `pingwaf_blocked_requests_total`, `pingwaf_active_connections`, `pingwaf_site_cache_used_bytes`). Rows are grouped by their label set and bucketed into `step`-second windows.

**Query params:**
| Param | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Required. Metric name, e.g. `pingwaf_requests_total`. |
| `from` | Inclusive lower bound, RFC 3339. Defaults to one hour before `to`. |
| `to` | Exclusive upper bound, RFC 3339. Defaults to now. |
| `step` | Bucket width in seconds, minimum 10. Defaults to 60. |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "name": "pingwaf_site_cache_used_bytes",
  "from": "2024-01-01T11:00:00Z",
  "to": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "step": 60,
  "series": [
    {
      "labels": { "site": "example.com" },
      "metric_type": 0,
      "points": [
        { "t": "2024-01-01T11:00:00Z", "avg": 1048576.0, "min": 1048576.0, "max": 1048576.0, "count": 2 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`metric_type`: `0` gauge, `1` counter. Metric samples are retained for 7 days by default (`PINGWAF_METRIC_RETENTION_DAYS`).

### DELETE /agents/{agent_id}

Deregister an agent.

### POST /agents/{agent_id}/commands

Send a command to an agent.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "command": "block_ip",
  "payload": {
    "ip": "1.2.3.4",
    "duration_secs": 3600
  }
}
```

**Available commands:**
| Command | Payload |
|---------|---------|
| `rule_update` | `{}` |
| `config_reload` | `{}` |
| `block_ip` | `{"ip": "...", "duration_secs": 3600}` |
| `unblock_ip` | `{"ip": "..."}` |
| `purge_cache` | `{"pattern": "..."}` |
| `update_site` | `{"site_id": "..."}` |
| `restart_agent` | `{}` |

  "priority": 100,
  "enabled": true
}
```

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/rule-groups/{group_id}

Update a rule group.

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/rule-groups/{group_id}

  "description": "Detects common SQLi patterns",
  "enabled": true,
  "priority": 10,
  "mode": "prevention",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "field": "uri",
      "operator": "regex",
      "value": "(?i)(union\\s+select|drop\\s+table)"
    }
  ],
  "action": "block",
  "tags": ["sqli", "owasp-a03"]
}
```

### GET /sites/{site_id}/rules/{rule_id}

Get rule details.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/rules/{rule_id}

Update a rule.

## Rate Limiting

### GET /sites/{site_id}/rate-limit-rules

List rate limit rules.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/rate-limit-rules

Create a rate limit rule.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "API Rate Limit",
  "expression": "",
  "enabled": true,
  "threshold": 100,
  "period_seconds": 60,
  "action": "block",
  "mitigation_timeout_seconds": 60,
  "characteristics": ["ip"],
  "priority": 100
}
```

`characteristics` accepts `ip`, `ip_nat`, `host`, `path`, `asn`, `country`, and the parameterized forms `header:<name>`, `cookie:<name>`, `query:<name>` (requests missing the value bucket together). Header names match case-insensitively; cookie and query names are case-sensitive. `ja3` is reserved for future use. `expression` is an optional filter — empty means all requests.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/rate-limit-rules/{rule_id}

Update a rate limit rule.

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/rate-limit-rules/{rule_id}

Delete a rate limit rule.

---

## Cache

### GET /sites/{site_id}/cache-rules

List cache rules for a site.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/cache-rules

Create a cache rule.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Static Assets",
  "path_pattern": "/static/*",
  "edge_ttl": 86400,
  "browser_ttl": 3600,
  "status": "enabled"
}
```

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/cache-rules/{rule_id}

Update a cache rule.

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/cache-rules/{rule_id}

Delete a cache rule.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/cache/defaults

Re-add the built-in cache rules that are missing, **disabled**, so caching can
be turned on with a single switch instead of writing rules from scratch. Rules
that already exist (matched by name) are left untouched, and the site's
configuration is pushed to its agents when anything was inserted.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "inserted": 2,
  "total": 5
}
```

`total` is the number of built-in rules; `inserted` how many were missing.

### GET /cache/status

Get cache usage across all sites.

### GET /cache/status/{site_id}

Get cache usage for a specific site.

### POST /cache/purge

Purge cached content.

**Request:**

### PUT /cache/rules/{rule_id}

Update by rule ID.

### DELETE /cache/rules/{rule_id}

Delete by rule ID.

## Logs

Every proxied request writes one `access_logs` row; a request the WAF acted on
also writes a `security_events` row that shares its `request_id` with the access
row, so a security event can be joined back to the full request and response.

The control plane keeps a third, separate log about *itself*:
`control_plane_access_logs` records the requests served by the dashboard and
REST API on port 9080. It is never mixed into the site logs, carries no site
id, and is readable by administrators only — see
[GET /logs/control-plane](#get-logscontrol-plane).

> **Headers and bodies are stored verbatim.** `Cookie`, `Authorization` and
> `Set-Cookie` values are deliberately *not* redacted — the console is meant to
> reproduce what a client actually sent — so `access_logs` is sensitive data.
> Keep the retention window short (`DELETE /logs/purge`) and restrict access.

Request and response bodies are prefixes: the agent stores at most
`max_body_log_size` bytes per direction (8 KiB by default, 64 KiB ceiling,
`capture_response_body` can switch response capture off). Both directions report
the real size and a `*_truncated` flag, so a short body is never mistaken for a
complete one.

Repeated header names are folded into the single value the stored map accepts:
most headers join with `, ` (the way HTTP prescribes), while `Set-Cookie`
values join with a newline (`\n`) — cookie values routinely carry commas of
their own inside `Expires` attributes, so a comma join would make the pairs
indistinguishable.

**Console search syntax.** The log pages accept one Kibana-style query string and
translate it into the parameters below, so the same filters are reachable from
the API:

```
client_ip:203.0.113.44      exact;  client_ip:203.0.113.*   prefix
client_ip:10.0.0.1,10.0.0.8 any of several values
path:/api/v1/users          substring;  status:404  status:4xx
method:POST,PUT   action:block   rule:xss-001
country:CN   cache_status:hit   latency:>500   site:<uuid>
from:2026-09-01  to:2026-09-02
api/v1/users                free text: matches path or host
```

Values containing spaces go in double quotes (`path:"/my files"`), `ip:` and
`rule:` alias `client_ip:` and `rule_id:`, and `method`, `action`, `rule` and
`cache_status` are only understood on the tab they belong to. A term the grammar
cannot place is reported to the operator rather than ignored.

### GET /logs/security

List security events, newest first.

**Query Parameters:**
| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `page` | int | Page number (default: 1) |
| `page_size` | int | Items per page (default: 50, max: 200) |
| `site_id` | string | Filter by site; omitted = every site the caller may see |
| `from` | string | RFC 3339 start (default: 24 hours ago) |

    {
      "id": 1,
      "site_id": "uuid",
      "agent_id": "uuid",
      "request_id": "6f1c…",

    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50
}
```

Rows are only as complete as the agent that produced them: `scheme`, `protocol`
and the response fields come from agents on 0.15.0 or newer. Against an older
agent those columns stay `null` and the console shows the request side only.

### GET /logs/control-plane

List the control plane's own access log (port 9080), newest first.
Administrators only: the table is cross-tenant and has no site column.
Recording is controlled by the `access_log_enabled` switch and
`access_log_retention_days` of
[PUT /settings/api-protection](#put-settingsapi-protection). Health probes
(`/healthz`, `/api/v1/health`) are exempt and write no rows.

**Query Parameters:**
| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `page` | int | Page number (default: 1) |
| `page_size` | int | Items per page (default: 50, max: 200) |
| `from` | string | RFC 3339 start (default: 24 hours ago) |
| `to` | string | RFC 3339 end (default: now) |
| `client_ip` | string | Exact IP; `a,b` for a list; `10.0.0.*` for a prefix |
| `method` | string | HTTP method, upper-cased server side (`a,b` for a list) |
| `action` | string | `allowed`, `blocked_allowlist`, `blocked_waf`, `observed_waf` (`a,b` for a list) |
| `status_code` | int | Exact status, 100-599 |
| `path` | string | Substring match on the request path |
| `host` | string | Request host (`*` wildcards allowed) |
| `request_id` | string | Exact request id |
| `q` | string | Free text; matches the path or the host |

`from` must be earlier than `to` and the window may not exceed 90 days.

**Response (200):** paginated `control_plane_access_logs` rows.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "request_id": "6f1c…",

      "protocol": "HTTP/1.1",
      "status_code": 200,
      "latency_ms": 12,
      "user_agent": "curl/8.4.0",
      "referer": null,
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "user_email": "admin@pingwaf.local",
      "action": "allowed",
      "reason": null
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50
}
```

`action` records what the listener's self-protection did with the request:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `allowed` | The request passed every check (the default). |
| `blocked_allowlist` | Refused with `403 ip_not_allowed` by the IP allowlist. |
| `blocked_waf` | Refused with `403 blocked_by_waf`, or `413 request_body_too_large` when the body exceeded the inspection limit. |
| `observed_waf` | A WAF match that was recorded but not enforced, either because `waf_mode` is `monitor` or because the engine itself rated the verdict monitor-only. |

`reason` carries the detail behind a non-`allowed` action and is `null`
otherwise. `user_id` and `user_email` are decoded from a Bearer token that
happens to be on the request, purely for the log — the handler still
authenticates for real, so an invalid token logs `null` for both. `client_ip`
is always the TCP peer, never a forwarding header: behind a reverse proxy the
proxy's address is what is logged (and must be allowlisted).

Rows are written asynchronously and in batches, so the newest seconds of
traffic may not be visible yet; a queue overflow drops records with a server
warning rather than stalling requests.

### DELETE /logs/purge

Delete log rows older than a cutoff. Administrators only.

**Query Parameters:**
| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `older_than_days` | int | Retention window in days, 1-3650 (default: 30) |
| `site_id` | string | Limit the purge to one site; omitted = every site |

```
DELETE /api/v1/logs/purge?older_than_days=30
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "deleted_security_events": 120,
  "deleted_access_logs": 8421,
  "deleted_control_plane_logs": 42,
  "cutoff": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

`deleted_control_plane_logs` counts rows removed from
`control_plane_access_logs`; it is always `0` when `site_id` is given, since
control plane rows carry no site. The scheduled sweep keeps that table to its
own window (`access_log_retention_days` of the API protection settings).

## Analytics

### GET /analytics/summary

Aggregate statistics for a time range.

**Query Parameters:** `site_id`, `from`, `to` (ISO 8601; default window is the last 24 hours, capped at 31 days)

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "from": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "to": "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z",
  "site_id": null,
  "requests": 125000,
  "unique_ips": 8900,
  "cache_hits": 98000,
  "cache_hit_rate": 0.784,
  "avg_latency_ms": 42,
  "max_latency_ms": 5120,
  "client_errors": 2100,
  "server_errors": 130,
  "security_events": 3650,
  "blocked_requests": 3200,
  "distinct_attackers": 412,
  "rules_triggered": 1880
}
```

### GET /analytics/requests-over-time

Time-series request data.

**Query Parameters:** `site_id`, `from`, `to`, `interval` (`minute`, `hour` (default), `day` or `week`), `limit`

### GET /analytics/traffic

Egress bandwidth per fixed-width bucket — response bytes streamed to clients only; origin-pull traffic is never counted. Without `site_id` the call covers every site the caller may see.

**Query Parameters:** `site_id`, `from`, `to`, `step` (bucket width in seconds; one of `5`, `10`, `30`, `60`, `300`, `900`, `3600`, `86400` — default `5`)

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "from": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "to": "2024-01-01T00:10:00Z",
  "site_id": null,
  "step_seconds": 5,
  "total_bytes": 536870912,
  "buckets": [
    {
      "bucket": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "bytes": 1048576
    }
  ]
}
```

### GET /analytics/sites-over-time

Request volume over time for the busiest sites — one series per site, for the dashboard's multi-line chart. Without `site_id` the top 8 sites by in-window traffic are returned; non-administrators are scoped to their own sites.

**Query Parameters:** `site_id`, `from`, `to`, `interval` (`minute`, `hour` (default), `day` or `week`)

**Response (200):**
```json
[
  {
    "bucket": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "site_id": "uuid",
    "site_domain": "example.com",
    "site_name": "My Site",
    "requests": 1520
  }
]
```

### GET /analytics/top-rules

Most triggered rules.

### GET /analytics/top-ips

Top client IPs by request count.

### GET /analytics/top-paths

Most requested paths.

### GET /analytics/status-codes

Distribution of HTTP response codes.

### GET /analytics/sites

Overview of all sites with request counts.

---

## IP Access Rules

### GET /sites/{site_id}/ip-rules

List IP access rules.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/ip-rules

Create an IP rule. Set either `ip_ranges` (manual mode) or `group_id` (reference a global/per-site IP group) — not both.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Known bad actor",
  "ip_ranges": ["192.168.1.0/24"],
  "action": "block",
  "note": "Blocked subnet",
  "enabled": true,
  "priority": 100
}
```

`action` is `block`, `allow`, `challenge`, `js_challenge` or `basic_auth`. Sending `group_id` instead of `ip_ranges` makes the rule track the group's latest ranges. A `basic_auth` rule challenges the matched clients and continues to the remaining checks once they authenticate; configure the credentials under [Basic Auth](#basic-auth) first.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/ip-rules/{rule_id}

Update an IP rule (sending `ip_ranges` or `group_id` switches between manual and group mode).

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/ip-rules/{rule_id}

Remove an IP rule.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/ip-rules/bulk

Bulk import IP rules (one IP or CIDR per entry).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "ip_ranges": ["1.2.3.4", "5.6.7.0/24"],
  "action": "block",
  "note": "Imported blocklist",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### GET /sites/{site_id}/blocked-ips

Dynamic blocks the edge currently enforces for the site — WAF/rate-limit auto-blocks and server-issued block commands. Every agent reports the blocks it enforces on each heartbeat; rows are folded per IP, with the attack history folded in from the security-event log.

**Response (200):**
```json
[
  {
    "ip": "203.0.113.7",
    "reason": "waf: SQL injection in query string",
    "blocked_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "expires_at": "2024-01-01T12:10:00Z",
    "agent_count": 2,
    "attack_count": 1842,
    "last_attack_at": "2024-01-01T11:59:58Z"
  }
]
```

`expires_at` is `null` for permanent blocks; `reason` may be `null` for blocks reported by older agents.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/blocked-ips/unblock

Lift a dynamic block: an `UnblockIp` command goes to every agent still enforcing it (queued when disconnected) and the mirrored rows are removed. Requires write permission.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "ip": "203.0.113.7"
}
```

**Response (202):**
```json
{
  "ip": "203.0.113.7",
  "agents": 2,
  "delivered": 2
}
```

---

## IP Groups

Named collections of IP ranges, global (`is_global`, applied to all sites) or per-site. Each group carries an `action` of `block` or `allow`, and can subscribe to an external list via `source_url` with a `sync_interval_minutes` refresh interval (`null` = manual sync only).

### GET /ip-groups

List IP groups (paginated), each with a `site_count`.

**Query Parameters:**
| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `page` | int | Page number |
| `page_size` | int | Items per page |
| `action` | string | Filter: `block` or `allow` |
| `is_global` | bool | Filter global/per-site groups |
| `enabled` | bool | Filter enabled/disabled |

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Cloudflare",
      "description": "Official Cloudflare IP ranges, refreshed daily from api.cloudflare.com.",
      "ip_ranges": ["173.245.48.0/20"],
      "action": "block",
      "is_global": true,
      "source_url": "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/ips",
      "sync_interval_minutes": 1440,
      "last_synced_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
      "last_sync_error": null,
      "enabled": false,
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "site_count": 0
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50
}
```

### POST /ip-groups

Create an IP group (up to 10000 ranges).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Office allowlist",
  "description": "Corporate egress IPs",
  "ip_ranges": ["203.0.113.7", "198.51.100.0/24"],
  "action": "allow",
  "is_global": false,
  "source_url": "https://example.com/ip-list.txt",
  "sync_interval_minutes": 1440,
  "enabled": true
}
```

### GET /ip-groups/{group_id}

Get an IP group with its `site_count`.

### PUT /ip-groups/{group_id}

Update an IP group (all fields optional).

### DELETE /ip-groups/{group_id}

Delete an IP group.

### GET /ip-groups/{group_id}/sites

List the sites associated with a per-site group.

### PUT /ip-groups/{group_id}/sites

Replace the site associations of a per-site group. Refused with `400` for global groups.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "site_ids": ["uuid"]
}
```

### POST /ip-groups/{group_id}/sync

Trigger an immediate subscription sync from `source_url`. On success the fetched ranges replace the stored ones; on failure the previous ranges are kept, the error is recorded in `last_sync_error`, and the API returns `502`.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "synced_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "ip_count": 15
}
```

---

## Geo Restrictions

### GET /sites/{site_id}/geo

Get geo restriction settings.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/geo

Update geo restrictions.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "mode": "block_list",
  "countries": ["CN", "RU", "IR"],
  "blocked_asns": ["AS13335"],
  "block_unknown": false,
  "action": "block"
}
```

`mode` is `block_list` or `allow_list`; `blocked_asns` entries are ASN numbers, optionally prefixed with `AS`. `action` is `block`, `challenge`, `js_challenge` or `basic_auth`.

### GET /sites/{site_id}/geo/stats

Requests per country over the last 24 hours (up to 20 countries), for the bar chart next to the policy editor. Traffic whose country could not be resolved is skipped.

**Response (200):**
```json
[
  {"country_code": "CN", "requests": 5210},
  {"country_code": "US", "requests": 1240}
]
```

---

## Basic Auth

HTTP basic authentication for one site. The check runs inside the WAF plugin,
ahead of the cache, so a stored response can never answer an unauthenticated
request. It applies site-wide when `enabled` is true, and to the clients an IP
or geo rule with the `basic_auth` action matches — an explicit `allow` rule
exempts a client from the site-wide gate.

Passwords are masked with `***` in responses; sending the mask back keeps the
stored password instead of overwriting it. Site write permission is required.

### GET /sites/{site_id}/basic-auth

Get the site's basic auth configuration, creating a disabled default when the
site never saved one.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "0d1b0f2e-…",
  "site_id": "6f1c…",
  "enabled": false,
  "realm": "Restricted",
  "credentials": [{"username": "alice", "password": "***"}],
  "delay_seconds": 1,
  "hide_credentials": false,
  "created_at": "2026-09-30T09:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-09-30T09:00:00Z"
}
```

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/basic-auth

Update basic auth. `credentials` replaces the whole list when present; `realm`
must be 1–200 characters, `delay_seconds` between 0 and 10, and usernames must
be non-empty and unique. Enabling the gate with no credential is rejected.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "realm": "Staging",
  "credentials": [
    {"username": "alice", "password": "hunter2"},
    {"username": "bob", "password": "***"}
  ],
  "delay_seconds": 1,
  "hide_credentials": true
}
```

---

## Bot Protection

### GET /sites/{site_id}/bot-protection

Get bot protection settings.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/bot-protection

Update bot protection.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "ua_analysis": true,
  "action": "challenge",
  "known_bots_whitelist": ["Googlebot", "bingbot"]
}
```

`action` is `block`, `challenge`, `js_challenge`, `log` or `allow` and is applied to traffic classified as a bot (non-browser user agents). `known_bots_whitelist` is a JSON array of case-insensitive User-Agent substrings that always pass.

---

## Challenge Settings

### GET /sites/{site_id}/challenge

Get challenge configuration.

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/challenge

Update challenge settings.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "mode": "passive",
  "type": "js_challenge",
  "expiry_secs": 3600
}
```

---

## Rewrite Rules

### GET /sites/{site_id}/rewrite-rules

List rewrite rules.

### POST /sites/{site_id}/rewrite-rules

Create a rewrite rule.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Strip API prefix",
  "type": "request",
  "match_pattern": "^/api/v1/(.*)",
  "replace_with": "/$1",
  "headers_add": {"X-Forwarded-By": "PingWAF"},
  "headers_remove": ["Server"],
  "priority": 10,
  "enabled": true
}
```

### PUT /sites/{site_id}/rewrite-rules/{rule_id}

Update a rewrite rule.

### DELETE /sites/{site_id}/rewrite-rules/{rule_id}

Delete a rewrite rule.

---

## Error Pages

A custom error page replaces the body of any response with a matching status
code — including responses the edge itself produces (a WAF block, a rate limit,
a paused site), not only ones that came from the origin. At most one page per
status code, and the pages are global: every site is served the same templates.
Administrators only, and edited from Settings in the dashboard.

A write pushes the new templates to every registered agent's next configuration
update, so no per-site publish is involved.

### GET /error-pages

List custom error pages (paginated), ordered by status code.

### POST /error-pages

Create a custom error page.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "status_code": 403,
  "name": "Access denied",
  "content_type": "text/html",
  "body_template": "<html><body><h1>Access Denied</h1><p>{{ request_id }}</p></body></html>",
  "enabled": true
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `status_code` | 400-599, unique |
| `name` | 1-200 characters |
| `content_type` | Defaults to `text/html` |
| `body_template` | Tera template, must not be empty |
| `enabled` | Defaults to `true`; a disabled page is skipped |

`body_template` renders with `request_id`, `error_code`, `error_message`,
`site_name`, `client_ip`, `timestamp`, `method`, `path` (aliased as
`request_path`), `host` (aliased as `request_host`) and `user_agent`. A template
that fails to render falls back to a plain-text body, so a typo cannot turn a
`403` into a `500`.

### PUT /error-pages/{page_id}

Update an error page; omitted fields keep their value.

### DELETE /error-pages/{page_id}

Delete an error page.

---

## Settings

### GET /settings/elasticsearch

Get Elasticsearch configuration.

### PUT /settings/elasticsearch

Update Elasticsearch settings.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "urls": ["http://elasticsearch:9200"],
  "index_prefix": "pingwaf",
  "username": "elastic",
  "password": "secret",
  "max_body_size": 8192
}
```

### POST /settings/elasticsearch/test

Test Elasticsearch connectivity.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Connected to Elasticsearch 8.12.0"
}
```

### GET /settings/log-retention

How long the PostgreSQL log tables are kept, in days. Administrators only. The
row is created with the default `180` days on first read.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "access_log_retention_days": 180,
  "security_event_retention_days": 180,
  "updated_at": "2026-09-30T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### PUT /settings/log-retention

Update one or both retention windows. Administrators only. Each value must be
between `1` and `3650` days.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "access_log_retention_days": 90,
  "security_event_retention_days": 365
}
```

A background sweep runs shortly after startup and then every six hours, so a
saved change takes effect without a restart. The optional `site_id` on
`DELETE /logs/purge` still narrows a manual purge; these settings configure the
automatic sweeps only. Elasticsearch archives are governed separately: the ILM
policy deletes indices after a fixed 360 days.

### GET /settings/defense

Global defense switches, stored as a single row. Administrators only.
Today that is observation mode: with it **on**, the data plane keeps every
detection running (WAF, IP and geo rules, bot protection, rate limiting) but
only records what it would have blocked — nothing is blocked, challenged or
rate-limited. Access control is never downgraded: mTLS, basic auth and a
paused site still take effect.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "observation_mode": false,
  "updated_at": "2026-10-03T00:00:00Z"
}
```

The row is created with `observation_mode: false` on first read.

### PUT /settings/defense

Set observation mode. Administrators only. The flag rides inside every rule
bundle, so a change marks all site configurations as changed and pushes fresh
bundles to the agents right away — no restart, no manual sync.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "observation_mode": true
}
```

`observation_mode` is required; a body without it is rejected with `400`.
A change made directly in the database — e.g. by the
`pingwaf mode observe` CLI on the server — is picked up and pushed by a
background watcher within about 15 seconds.

**Response (200):** the updated row, same shape as `GET`.

### GET /settings/api-protection

The 9080 listener's self-protection: its own access log, IP allowlist and
WAF. Administrators only. The row is created on first read with the defaults
shown below.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "access_log_enabled": true,
  "access_log_retention_days": 30,
  "ip_allowlist_enabled": false,
  "ip_allowlist_ranges": [],
  "ip_allowlist_group_id": null,
  "waf_enabled": false,
  "waf_mode": "block",
  "updated_at": "2026-10-03T00:00:00Z",
  "effective_allowlist_entries": 0
}
```

`effective_allowlist_entries` is what the allowlist resolves to right now:
the inline ranges plus the ranges of the referenced group (a disabled group
contributes nothing); `0` while the allowlist is switched off.

While a guard is on, a request it refuses never reaches the API: the
allowlist answers `403` with error code `ip_not_allowed`, the WAF answers
`403 blocked_by_waf` (or `413 request_body_too_large` for a body above the
inspection limit), and either refusal is recorded in
`GET /logs/control-plane`.

### PUT /settings/api-protection

Update any subset of the settings. Administrators only. Every field is
optional — omitted fields keep their current value, so a JSON body may hold
just the one switch being changed. A successful write rebuilds the
in-process policy before responding, so the change applies to the next 9080
request.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "access_log_enabled": true,
  "access_log_retention_days": 30,
  "ip_allowlist_enabled": true,
  "ip_allowlist_ranges": ["203.0.113.4", "10.0.0.0/8"],
  "ip_allowlist_group_id": "uuid",
  "waf_enabled": true,
  "waf_mode": "monitor",
  "force": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `access_log_enabled` | bool | Record one row per 9080 request (see `GET /logs/control-plane`). |
| `access_log_retention_days` | int | Retention window for that log, 1-3650 days. |
| `ip_allowlist_enabled` | bool | Restrict the API to the allowlist below. |
| `ip_allowlist_ranges` | string[] | Addresses and CIDRs; blanks are dropped, each entry must parse. |
| `ip_allowlist_group_id` | string | Reference an `ip_groups` row; `""` clears the reference; omit or `null` to keep it. |
| `waf_enabled` | bool | Inspect API requests with the embedded WAF engine. |
| `waf_mode` | string | `block` or `monitor`; monitor only records matches (they show up as `observed_waf`). |
| `force` | bool | Apply a change the lockout guard below would refuse. |

Validation failures return `400`: an unparsable allowlist entry, a retention
outside 1-3650 days, an unknown `ip_groups` reference, or a `waf_mode` other
than `block` / `monitor`.

**Lockout guard.** A write that leaves the allowlist enabled without covering
the connection sending it is refused with `422`, because it would lock the
operator out of the console they are using:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unprocessable_entity",
    "message": "the new allowlist does not include your address (203.0.113.7); add it first, or send force=true to apply anyway"
  }
}
```

Add the address (or retry with `force: true`) to apply it anyway. The
`pingwaf security allowlist off` CLI on the server is the escape hatch when
HTTP access is already gone.

**Response (200):** the same view as `GET`.

---

## Control-plane certificate

The certificate the dashboard and REST API are served with. Administrators
only: the private key never leaves the server and no endpoint returns it.

A self-signed pair (EC P-256, `CN=PingWAF Control Plane`) is generated on first
boot when TLS is enabled and nothing has been stored yet. Replacing it takes
effect immediately — the listener swaps the pair in place, so no restart is
needed. Passkeys require a secure origin, which is the reason this exists.

### GET /system/tls

Current status, including the active certificate's metadata.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "has_certificate": true,
  "certificate": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "source": "self_signed",
    "subject_dn": "CN=PingWAF Control Plane",
    "common_name": "PingWAF Control Plane",
    "sans": ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "waf.example.com"],
    "serial": "1f0c…",
    "fingerprint_sha256": "3b1a…",
    "not_before": "2026-09-30T00:00:00Z",
    "not_after": "2028-12-30T00:00:00Z",
    "created_at": "2026-09-30T00:00:00Z",
    "expires_in_days": 821
  },
  "default_sans": ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "waf.example.com"],
  "max_validity_days": 3650
}
```

`enabled` mirrors `tls_enabled`; `has_certificate` reports whether the running
listener holds a usable pair. `certificate` is omitted when nothing is stored.

### GET /system/tls/certificate

Download the certificate in use (PEM, chain included) as
`application/x-pem-file`. Handy for pinning or for installing the self-signed
pair into a trust store.

### PUT /system/tls/certificate

Upload a certificate and its private key. The pair is validated before anything
is written: a mismatched key or an unparsable chain returns `400` and the
running listener keeps serving the previous certificate.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n…\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
  "key_pem": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n…\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
}
```

`cert_pem` carries the leaf first, then intermediates when the issuer is not a
root. `key_pem` accepts PKCS#8, PKCS#1 or SEC1 (`RSA`, `EC` and `PKCS8`
begin-lines are all understood).

**Response (200):** the same shape as `GET /system/tls`.

### POST /system/tls/certificate/self-signed

Generate and install a fresh self-signed certificate.

**Request** (every field optional):
```json
{
  "common_name": "PingWAF Control Plane",
  "sans": ["waf.example.com", "10.0.0.5"],
  "validity_days": 825
}
```

Defaults: the configured console common name, the deployment's alternative
names (configured `tls_sans` plus the host name, the passkey relying party,
`localhost` and `127.0.0.1`, and the host the request arrived on), and 825 days
(capped at `max_validity_days`, 3650).

**Response (200):** the same shape as `GET /system/tls`.

## AI assistant

The built-in assistant behind the console's **AI Assistant** page. A turn runs
an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions loop (streaming when the provider
supports it) and hands the model the same tool registry that backs the
[MCP server](#mcp-server), so it can inspect sites, agents, certificates,
traffic and logs — and, when allowed, change sites.

Every endpoint in this section is administrators only: one provider key is
shared across the fleet and the tools reach every site.

### GET /settings/ai

The assistant's configuration, stored as a single row. The row is created with
the defaults shown below on first read.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  "api_key": "",
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "system_prompt": "You are the built-in assistant of PingWAF, a reverse-proxy and web application firewall console. …",
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "max_tool_rounds": 5,
  "allow_write_tools": false,
  "updated_at": "2026-10-03T00:00:00Z"
}
```

`api_key` is `***` when a key is stored and empty when none is; the stored key
is never returned. `system_prompt` is the prompt in effect: the saved override,
or the full built-in default (shown abbreviated above) when no override is
stored.

### PUT /settings/ai

Update any subset of the settings; omitted fields keep their stored value.
`api_key` follows the secret round-trip: omitted or `null` keeps the stored
key, `***` keeps it too (what the dashboard sends when the field was left
untouched), and `""` clears it. Enabling the assistant requires a `base_url`
(http or https), a `model` and a key; an incomplete configuration is refused
with `400`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | Master switch. While off, chat turns are refused with `409`. |
| `base_url` | string | OpenAI-compatible API root, at most 500 characters. |
| `api_key` | string | Provider key; see the round-trip rules above. |
| `model` | string | Model name, at most 200 characters. |
| `system_prompt` | string | Overrides the built-in prompt; `""` clears the override so the default applies again. |
| `temperature` | number | 0–2. |
| `max_tool_rounds` | int | Tool-calling rounds per answer, 1–10. |
| `allow_write_tools` | bool | Let the assistant call the site-mutating tools. |

**Response (200):** the same view as `GET`.

### POST /settings/ai/test

Probe a provider. The JSON body may hold any subset of the fields above;
absent fields fall back to the stored row, and the probe runs with `enabled`
forced on, so a draft can be tested before it is saved. The model is asked for
a one-word reply.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "reply": "ok",
  "error": null
}
```

A reachable provider that answers with an error still returns `200` with
`ok: false` and the provider's message in `error`; only an unusable
configuration (missing URL or model) is a `400`.

### GET /ai/conversations

List conversations, newest first. Supports the standard pagination query
(`page`, `page_size`).

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "title": "Why is example.com returning 502s?",
      "created_at": "2026-10-03T00:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-10-03T00:05:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 20
}
```

The `title` is derived from the first message (first line, 60 characters,
ellipsised) and stays empty until the first message is sent.

### POST /ai/conversations

Create an empty conversation. `title` is optional (at most 200 characters) and
usually left out — the first message names the conversation.

**Response (201):** the conversation summary.

### GET /ai/conversations/{conversation_id}

One conversation with its messages, oldest first, capped at the most recent
500. `404` for an unknown id.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "Why is example.com returning 502s?",
  "created_at": "2026-10-03T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-10-03T00:05:00Z",
  "messages": [
    { "id": "uuid", "role": "user", "content": "…", "created_at": "…" },
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "",
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "id": "call_1",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "query_access_logs",
            "arguments": "{\"status_class\":5}"
          }
        }
      ],
      "created_at": "…"
    },
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "role": "tool",
      "content": "{\"rows\":[…]}",
      "tool_call_id": "call_1",
      "tool_name": "query_access_logs",
      "created_at": "…"
    }
  ]
}
```

`tool_calls` appears on assistant messages only, and `tool_call_id` /
`tool_name` on tool messages only.

### DELETE /ai/conversations/{conversation_id}

Delete a conversation and its messages (cascade). **Response:** `204`.

### POST /ai/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages

Run one turn: the message is stored, then the model may call tools (at most
`max_tool_rounds` rounds) before it answers.

**Request:**
```json
{ "content": "Which sites returned 5xx in the last hour?" }
```

With `Accept: text/event-stream` the response is an SSE stream of JSON events,
one `data:` line per event:

| Event | Payload | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `conversation` | `{"id","title"}` | Sent first when the first message names the conversation. |
| `delta` | `{"text"}` | Incremental assistant text. |
| `tool_call` | `{"id","name","arguments"}` | The model requested a tool call. |
| `tool_result` | `{"id","name","result","is_error"}` | The tool answered; `result` is its raw JSON. |
| `done` | `{"content"}` | The turn finished; `content` is the final answer. |
| `error` | `{"message"}` | The turn failed; the message is safe to display. |

Without that header the same events are folded into one buffered JSON
response once the turn completes:

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "uuid",
  "content": "The final answer…",
  "tool_calls": [
    { "id": "call_1", "name": "query_access_logs", "arguments": {}, "result": {}, "is_error": false }
  ]
}
```

Errors: `400` for an empty or oversized message (8 000 characters), `404` for
an unknown conversation, `409` when the assistant is disabled or its provider
configuration is incomplete. A failure during the turn arrives as an `error`
event in SSE mode and as `502 Bad Gateway` in buffered mode.

## MCP server

The control plane hosts an MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoint at `/mcp` —
note the path hangs off the root of the TLS listener, not under `/api/v1`. It
speaks MCP over **Streamable HTTP**: clients `POST` JSON-RPC 2.0 messages and
receive JSON responses; `GET` and `DELETE` answer `405` so probing clients
fall back to POST. The endpoint is stateless — no `Mcp-Session-Id` is issued.

Authentication reuses the console credentials: `Authorization: Bearer` with
either a `pwk_…` API key or a user JWT. A key needs the `read` permission (and
its owner must be an administrator) to be accepted at all; the write tools
additionally require the `write` permission on the key. JWT sessions use the
token's role directly — administrators may call every tool, viewers none.

Supported methods: `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`,
`resources/list`, `resources/read`, `resources/templates/list`,
`prompts/list`, `prompts/get`, `logging/setLevel` (accepted, no-op), and
JSON-RPC batches thereof. Notifications receive `202 Accepted`.

Because the route hangs off the root router, the 9080 self-protection stack —
access log, IP allowlist, WAF ([see API protection](#get-settingsapi-protection))
— applies to `/mcp` exactly as it does to the REST API.

### GET /settings/mcp

Introspection for the MCP endpoint, used by the Settings card: where the
endpoint lives and what this build exposes. Any authenticated console user
(viewers included — they may connect read-only).

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "path": "/mcp",
  "transport": "streamable_http",
  "tools": [
    { "name": "list_sites", "write": false },
    { "name": "set_site_status", "write": true }
  ],
  "prompts": 3,
  "resources": 5
}
```

`tools` lists the full catalogue in order, `write` marking the tools that
require a write credential. `prompts` and `resources` count what
`prompts/list` and `resources/list` will serve.

### Connecting a client

Point the client at `<console origin>/mcp` and authenticate with a `pwk_…`
API key (create one under **Settings → API keys** with the `read` permission,
plus `write` for the write tools). A generic Streamable HTTP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pingwaf": {
      "url": "https://waf.example.com:9080/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer pwk_YOUR_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code takes the same settings in one command:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http pingwaf https://waf.example.com:9080/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer pwk_YOUR_KEY"
```

### Tools

The registry is shared with the AI assistant; `tools/list` returns only the
tools the calling credential may use (write tools are hidden from read-only
credentials).

| Tool | Write | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `list_sites` | | Sites with status and online agent count. |
| `list_agents` | | Agents with status, version and heartbeat. |
| `certificate_summary` | | TLS certificate counts, including expiring-in-30-days. |
| `query_access_logs` | | Recent proxied requests; the primary diagnosis tool. |
| `query_waf_events` | | WAF detections with rule, request and action. |
| `get_traffic_summary` | | Aggregated traffic for a window. |
| `get_defense_status` | | Observation mode and the control plane's own guards. |
| `list_ip_groups` | | Shared IP groups with size and sync state. |
| `query_control_plane_logs` | | The 9080 access log, including allowlist/WAF verdicts. |
| `set_observation_mode` | ✓ | Turn global observation mode on or off. |
| `set_site_status` | ✓ | Activate or pause one site. |

Errors follow the JSON-RPC convention: `-32601` for an unknown method,
`-32602` for invalid parameters, and a tool's own failure is returned as a
result with `isError: true` and the message in the content text.

### Resources and prompts

`resources/list` exposes the fleet's readable state as MCP resources, each
with a `pingwaf://` URI (defense status, sites, agents, certificates, traffic
and the control-plane log). `prompts/list` offers ready-made troubleshooting
prompts — incident triage, traffic report, security review and certificate
audit — that clients can surface as one-click actions.

## Debug & Profiling

Built-in pprof-style profiling of the control-plane process. All endpoints require an admin token. Sampling is process-global: while a capture is running, further requests return `409 Conflict`.

CPU sampling requires Linux (the only platform with a signal-safe unwinder for the sampling handler); on other platforms the capture endpoints return `501 Not Implemented`, while `/debug/pprof/memory` works everywhere.

Symbols are resolved from the binary's symbol table. The default `release` profile strips symbols, so most frames read `Unknown` — profile a `release-perf` build (`make release-perf`) to get readable flame graphs.

### GET /debug/pprof/profile

Capture CPU samples and return a gzip-compressed pprof protobuf consumable by `go tool pprof` and speedscope.

**Query:** `?seconds=30&frequency=99` — capture window (1-120 s, default 30) and sampling frequency in Hz (1-1000, default 99).

```bash
go tool pprof -http=: -insecure https://localhost:9080/api/v1/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30
```

### GET /debug/pprof/flamegraph

Capture CPU samples and return an SVG flamegraph viewable directly in a browser. Same query parameters as above.

```bash
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://localhost:9080/api/v1/debug/pprof/flamegraph?seconds=30" > flamegraph.svg
```

### GET /debug/pprof/memory

JSON snapshot of process RSS and system memory (no sampling, returns immediately).

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "rss_bytes": 120258048,
  "virtual_bytes": 805984256,
  "total_memory_bytes": 17179869184,
  "used_memory_bytes": 9663676416,
  "rss": "121.2 MB",
  "total_memory": "16.0 GB",
  "used_memory": "9.0 GB",
  "collected_at_ms": 1727443200000
}
```

The data plane (pingap) exposes the same three endpoints under its admin path: `GET {admin-path}/api/pprof/profile`, `.../flamegraph` and `.../memory`, authenticated by the admin plugin's credentials. See [Profiling](profiling.md).

---

## Error Responses

All errors follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_found",
    "message": "Site not found"
  }
}
```

| HTTP Status | Code | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| 400 | `bad_request` | Invalid input |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Missing or invalid token |
| 403 | `forbidden` | Insufficient permissions |
| 404 | `not_found` | Resource does not exist |
| 409 | `conflict` | Duplicate resource |
| 422 | `unprocessable_entity` | Validation failed by a business rule |
| 429 | `too_many_requests` | Rate limited (passkey challenges) |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Server error |
| 501 | `not_implemented` | Feature disabled on this deployment (passkeys) |

---

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination:

**Query:** `?page=1&page_size=50`

| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `page` | int | Page number, 1-based (default: 1) |
| `page_size` | int | Items per page (default: 50, maximum: 200) |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "total": 100,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50
}
```

`total` is the number of rows matching the filters, not the size of `items`.

## Log retention

Log rows are swept automatically: the control plane deletes rows older than the
configured windows (see `GET/PUT /settings/log-retention`, default `180` days
for both tables) every six hours. `DELETE /logs/purge` remains available for an
ad-hoc cleanup and deletes rows older than `older_than_days` (default 30) for
one site or, for an administrator, for every site.

The control plane's own access log has its own window,
`access_log_retention_days` on `GET/PUT /settings/api-protection` (default
`30` days). The scheduled sweep enforces it; an ad-hoc `DELETE /logs/purge`
without `site_id` trims it with the same `older_than_days` as the site logs.
