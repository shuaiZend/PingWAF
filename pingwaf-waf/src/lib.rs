//! PingWAF detection engine.
//!
//! Multi-stage request inspection:
//! 1. Normalize / decode input (URL, HTML entities, path traversal collapsing).
//! 2. Stage 1 — fast path: Aho-Corasick signature scan plus libinjection-style
//!    SQLi / XSS detectors. Target ≤ 100µs.
//! 3. Stage 2 — rule engine: expression-based custom and managed rules with
//!    anomaly scoring. Target ≤ 300µs.
//! 4. Emit a [`WafVerdict`] describing the action, score and matched rules.
