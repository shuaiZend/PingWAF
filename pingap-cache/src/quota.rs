//! Per-domain disk quota accounting.
//!
//! [`FileCache`] already keeps a *global* on-disk budget (`max_size`) for the
//! whole backend directory. That is the wrong granularity for a multi-tenant
//! edge: one noisy domain can consume the entire budget and starve every other
//! site sharing the box. [`DiskQuotaManager`] is the per-domain ledger that
//! sits next to it - the namespace of a cache key (the site domain) is the
//! accounting unit, and each domain gets its own ceiling and its own LRU
//! eviction.
//!
//! Hot path rules, because this is called from every cache write and hit:
//! - counters are `AtomicU64` with relaxed ordering, so a read is a load;
//! - a domain with no configured quota is not even entered into the map, so
//!   untracked traffic costs one failed hash lookup and nothing else;
//! - eviction (the only part that touches the disk) happens off the request
//!   path, and only one task per domain runs it at a time.
//!
//! Usage is rebuilt from the cache directory on startup ([`DiskQuotaManager::load`]),
//! so a restart does not reset a domain to "empty" and allow a large overshoot
//! before the ledger catches up. Quota ceilings themselves are persisted next
//! to the cache in `.quota.json`.
//!
//! Ceilings can also arrive *before* the ledger does: the agent learns them
//! from the control plane the moment it connects, while the ledger is created
//! by the first file cache backend. [`set_quota`] parks those until the ledger
//! shows up, so the ordering of the two never decides whether a limit is
//! enforced at all.
