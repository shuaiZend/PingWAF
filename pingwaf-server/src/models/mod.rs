//! SeaORM entities for every table created by [`crate::migration`].
//!
//! Each table lives in an inner module named after the table (the shape
//! `DeriveEntityModel` generates: `Entity`, `Model`, `ActiveModel`, `Column`,
//! `Relation`). The inner modules are re-exported here under their singular
//! names so call sites read as `models::site::Entity` instead of
//! `models::sites::sites::Entity`.
//!
//! The inner module names necessarily match their file names (SeaORM's
//! `DeriveEntityModel` shape), so `module_inception` is expected here.
